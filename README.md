# Docker-VM-Runner

Run lightweight QEMU/KVM virtual machines within Docker. Each container hosts a libvirt-managed VM with optional Redfish control and noVNC console support. Images are pulled automatically from upstream cloud sources or can be supplied locally.

## Background

I rely on containers to avoid polluting host machines while developing applications, but containerized environments have limits around systemd, networking, and kernel features. Docker-VM-Runner bridges that gap by making it just as easy to spin up a full virtual machine: a single `docker run` fetches the requested cloud image, boots it, and attaches your terminal to the VM console immediately.

## Quick Start

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  --name vm1 \
  --hostname vm1 \
  -p 2222:2222 \
  --device /dev/kvm:/dev/kvm \
  ghcr.io/munenick/docker-vm-runner:latest
```

- SSH: `ssh -p 2222 <user>@localhost` (user depends on the distro).
- Optional Redfish API: add `-e REDFISH_ENABLE=1 -p 8443:8443` and visit `https://localhost:8443` (`admin` / `password`).
- Multi-arch images: published tags target both `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`; with host KVM available the guest runs on its native architecture.

For persistence, GUI, ISO installs, and compose workflows see the [documentation](docs/README.md) â€” start with [Quick Start](docs/quick-start.md) for additional `docker run` variants.

## Highlights

- KVM acceleration with automatic fallback to TCG when `/dev/kvm` is unavailable.
- Libvirt manages lifecycle, with optional sushy-emulator (Redfish) power/boot control.
- Cloud-init injects default credentials and optional SSH keys.
- Optional noVNC web console with TLS, local ISO/blank disk workflows, and docker-compose support.
